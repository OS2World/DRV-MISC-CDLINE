This is a replacement driver for the CDD.SYS driver.

To install it place the line -

DEVICE=X:\PATH\CMDLINE.SYS 

in your config.sys file. Where X is the drive that has CMDLINE.SYS
on it and PATH is the path of CMDLINE.SYS.

When you boot up you will see the prompt -

Press ESC for command prompt...

If you press the ESC key, you will get a command prompt
that should allow you to modify your system. I have found 
this to be a useful utility to help fix problems that were
caused by installing some software that causes the system
to trap on boot up.

I have placed this driver in the Public Domain, but retain
a copyright on it. You may use this driver and it's source
for any purpose you see fit. Note that I take no responsibility
for any problems with the operation on this code. If you have
any problems, I can be reached through CIS:76701,122 and 
BIX:pcquote.
